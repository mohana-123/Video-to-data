This is the data entry project I have done recently to improve myself the skill to contribute to the organisation 

## Project Name: 
Video to Text Data Convert

### Skills: 
MS Excel, MS Word, Data Entry, Google Docs, Content Writing, Market Research, Business Research

### Project Details:

I was hired by this project for a long time ago. Firstly I was given a 1 hour documentary video to prescribe in MS Word. There are a lot of information and you know speaking is faster than writing. Firstly I was getting trouble to listen and keep pace with the track.

Gradually I was learning and doing my best and became faster typist. After that I was given a lot of videos to convert them to words. And I was feeling interesting and finding peppiness from my work.

After a long time I had completed thousands of transcription and gain a record of the biggest earner in this project. It was my pleasure to be a part of this large organization. It was one of my successful projects.
